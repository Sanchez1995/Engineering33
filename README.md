Agile software development values

1) Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools
2) Working Software over comprehensive documentation
3) Customer Collaboration over contract negotiation
4) Responding to Change over following a plan


12 principles that the Manifesto for Agile Software Development is based on

1) Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2) Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.
3) Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months)
4) Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
5) Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
6) Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
7) Working software is the primary measure of progress
8) Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
9) Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
10) Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
11) Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
12) Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly


What is scrum?

Scrum is an agile framework for completing complex projects.

The Scrum framework:

  · A product owner creates a prioritized wish list called a product backlog.

  · During sprint planning, the team pulls a small chunk from the top of that wish list, a sprint backlog, and decides how to implement those pieces.

  · The team is given a certain amount of time, a sprint, to complete its work - usually two to four weeks - but meets each day to assess its progress (daily scrum).

  · during sprints the Scrum Master keeps the team focused on its goal.

  · At the end of the sprint, the work should be potentially deliverable, as in ready to hand to a customer, put on a store shelf, or show to a stakeholder.

  · The sprint ends with a sprint review and retrospective.

  · As the next sprint begins, the team chooses another chunk of the product backlog and begins working again. 

The cycle repeats until enough items in the product backlog have been completed, the budget is depleted, or a deadline arrives. Which of these milestones marks the end of the work is entirely specific to the project. No matter which impetus stops work, Scrum ensures that the most valuable work has been completed when the project ends.
