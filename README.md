Agile software development values

1) Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools
2) Working Software over comprehensive documentation
3) Customer Collaboration over contract negotiation
4) Responding to Change over following a plan


12 principles that the Manifesto for Agile Software Development is based on

1) Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2) Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.
3) Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months)
4) Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
5) Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
6) Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
7) Working software is the primary measure of progress
8) Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
9) Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
10) Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
11) Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
12) Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly


### Scrum Events - Ceremonies
- Sprints are a short, time-boxed series of iterations that breaks down big, complex projects into smaller tasks. This creates manageable sections allowing teams to ship high-quality work faster and more frequently, and gives them more flexibility to adapt to change.
- Sprint Planning
- Daily Scrum/Stand-Up
- Sprint Reviews
