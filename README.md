Agile software development values

1) Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools
2) Working Software over comprehensive documentation
3) Customer Collaboration over contract negotiation
4) Responding to Change over following a plan


12 principles that the Manifesto for Agile Software Development is based on

1) Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2) Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.
3) Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months)
4) Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
5) Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
6) Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
7) Working software is the primary measure of progress
8) Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
9) Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
10) Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
11) Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
12) Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly

Scrum vs Agile

Agile – is a methodology based on an iterative and incremental approach. 
It can be viewed as addressing the communication gap between customers 
and developers.
•	Agile method focuses on people and is more 
communication-oriented
•	Agile methods are tested in a dynamic environment and prove to 
be very flexible by adapting to the change happening in the business.

Scrum – is a framework that allows you to implement the agile 
methodology. It allows self-organizing teams to focus on delivering the 
highest business value in the shortest time. Using an iterative 
development, it allows us to rapidly develop and repeatedly inspect 
working software every two to four weeks (a sprint or iteration).
Cons:
•	Transitions to agile can be painful
Pros:
•	Frequent releases mean the customer always knows where the 
project is going and can make simple course corrections.
•	Burndown charts and the product backlog provide the product 
owner and other stakeholders continuous visibility on the project’s 
status
•	Each phase is a result of the process of previous steps
•	The process should be repeatedly checked for consistency
•	A single iteration would not give a clear picture of the 
process.
